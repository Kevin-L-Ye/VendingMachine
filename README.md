# VendingMachine
My first capstone project for Tech Elevator's bootcamp!  Pair project with Molly Fronius.

A C# console application created in Visual Studio, which simulates a vending machine with limited stock and prices for each product.
Users can enter a product selection, and money in $1, $2, and $5 increments, per the original project requirements.
